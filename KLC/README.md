KLC Wide Layouts
================

Based on the [Colemak Wide Layout](http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=839). However I wanted an implemetation that was a Windows installable layout, and would suitable be for UK keyboards, hence this package. I have also made available a UK Qwerty version.

At first sight, it may look a bit strange to have the brackets in the middle of the keyboard! I was skeptical when I first heard of this idea but having tried it out, I now believe it to be an excellent innovation. Introducing a greater separation between the hands gives you several advantages, especially for touch-typists:

- Adopt a more comfortable typing posture by keeping a greater separation between your hands.
- Easier access to keys on the right-hand side, e.g. Return, Backspace, right shift.
- Reduces the load and strain on the overused right pinky finger.
- Also allows AltGr to be easily typed with the right thumb - works well in conjuction with the [AltGr programmer extention](../AltGr/)

The main disadvantage is that your key caps will no longer show the correct letters, and the "home position" small bump key will be in the wrong place. But if you are a touch-typist that may not be a concern. Alternatively, you could get some inexpensive stickers or physically switch your keys if supported by your keyboard.
