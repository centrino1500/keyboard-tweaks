KLC Wide Layouts
================

Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (KLC) files for ergonomic, Wide layouts.

Based on the [Colemak Wide Layout](http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=839). However I wanted an implementation that was a Windows installable layout, and would suitable be for UK keyboards, hence this package. There is both a Qwerty and Colemak version available.

At first sight, it may look a bit strange to have the brackets in the middle of the keyboard! I was skeptical when I first heard of this idea but having tried it out, I now believe it to be an excellent innovation. Introducing a greater separation between the hands gives you several advantages, especially for touch-typists:

- Adopt a more comfortable typing posture by increasing the separation between your hands.
- Easier access to keys on the right-hand side, e.g. Return, Backspace, Right Shift.
- Reduces load and strain on the overused right pinky finger.
- Also allows AltGr to be easily typed with the right thumb - works well in conjuction with the [AltGr programmer extension](../AltGr/)
- Gain an ergonomic benefit without needing to learn a new keyboard layout.

The main disadvantage is that your key caps will no longer show the correct letters, and the home position maker (small bump) key will be in the wrong place. But if you are a touch-typist, you won't be looking ath the keyboard and so it may not be a concern. Alternatively, you could get some inexpensive stickers, or physically switch your keycaps if supported by your keyboard.
