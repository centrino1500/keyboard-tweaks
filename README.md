Ideas and scripts for optimizing your keyboard.

This project contains mostly [AutoHotkey](http://ahkscript.org/ "AutoHotkey") scripts for making your typing experience more comfortable and efficient.

To try out any of the scripts, download and install the excellent AutoHotkey and then run the script. Or choose "Edit This Script" from the AutoHotkey menu and paste in the script you want to try.

## AutoHotkey scripts

[AltGr scripts](AltGr/ "AltGr scripts")
- AltGr Progammer extension - making available commonly needed programmer keys such as brackets and symbols available in convenient locations.
- AltGr International extension - making a variety of accented characters, currency, mathematical and other symbols all available via the AltGr key.

[CapsLayer scripts](CapsLayer/ "CapsLayer scripts]")
- Re-use CapsLock for something much more useful. This script provides a navigation layer via holding CapsLock and pressing other keys. Includes arrow keys, home, end, page up/down and more. Actual CapsLock is still available via AltGr+CapsLock.

[Misc scripts](Misc/ "Misc scripts]")
- Other miscellaneous AutoHotkey scripts: sticky shift, numeric keypad layer.
